file permissions control who can access and modify files and directories. 
There are three basic permission types:   

Read (r): Allows viewing the contents of a file or listing the contents of a directory.   
Write (w): Allows modifying the contents of a file or adding, removing, or renaming files within a directory.   
Execute (x): Allows running a file as a program or accessing a directory.   
These permissions are assigned to three categories of users:   

Owner (u): The user who owns the file or directory.   
Group (g): The group associated with the file or directory.   
Others (o): All other users on the system.   
Symbolic Representation

Permissions are commonly represented using a string of 10 characters. The first character indicates the file type (e.g., - for a regular file, d for a directory). The next nine characters represent the permissions for the owner, group, and others, in that order.

For example, -rw-r--r-- means:

-: Regular file
rw-: Owner has read and write permissions.
r--: Group has read permission.
r--: Others have read permission.
Numeric Representation (Octal Mode)

Permissions can also be represented using a three-digit octal number. Each digit represents the permissions for the owner, group, and others, respectively. The values are calculated as follows:   

Read (r): 4
Write (w): 2
Execute (x): 1   
To get the numeric value for a category, you add up the values of the permissions granted. For example:   

rwx: 4 + 2 + 1 = 7
rw-: 4 + 2 + 0 = 6
r-x: 4 + 0 + 1 = 5
r--: 4 + 0 + 0 = 4
-wx: 0 + 2 + 1 = 3
-w-: 0 + 2 + 0 = 2
--x: 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
---: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0
Therefore, -rw-r--r-- in numeric mode is 644.

Special Permissions

In addition to the basic permissions, there are three special permissions:

Set User ID (SUID): When set on an executable file, it allows the file to be executed with the privileges of the owner, regardless of who runs it. Represented by s in the owner's execute position (e.g., -rwsr-xr-x) or 4 as the first digit in numeric mode (e.g., 4755).   
Set Group ID (SGID): When set on an executable file, it causes the file to be executed with the privileges of the group owner. When set on a directory, new files created within the directory inherit the group ownership of the directory. Represented by s in the group's execute position (e.g., -rwxr-sr-x) or 2 as the first digit in numeric mode (e.g., 2755).   
Sticky Bit: When set on a directory, it restricts file deletion within the directory to the file owner, directory owner, and root user. Represented by t in the others' execute position (e.g., -rwxr-xr-t) or 1 as the first digit in numeric mode (e.g., 1755).   
Examples

Here are some examples of file permissions and their meanings:

-rwxr-xr-x (755):** The owner has full permissions, while the group and others have read and execute permissions. This is common for executable files.   
-rw-r--r-- (644):** The owner has read and write permissions, while the group and others have only read permission. This is common for data files.
drwxr-xr-x (755):** The owner has full permissions on the directory, while the group and others can list the directory contents and access files within it.   
-rwsr-xr-x (4755):** The SUID bit is set. The file will run with the owner's privileges.
-rwxr-sr-x (2755):** The SGID bit is set. The file will run with the group's privileges.
drwxr-xr-t (1755):** The sticky bit is set. Only the owner of a file within this directory, the directory's owner, or the root user can delete files.   
Changing Permissions

The chmod command is used to change file permissions. It can be used in symbolic or numeric mode.   

Symbolic Mode Examples:

chmod u+x file.txt: Adds execute permission for the owner.
chmod g-w file.txt: Removes write permission for the group.
chmod o=r file.txt: Sets read permission for others and removes any other permissions.
chmod a+r file.txt: Adds read permission for all users.
Numeric Mode Examples:

chmod 755 file.txt: Sets permissions to rwxr-xr-x.
chmod 644 file.txt: Sets permissions to rw-r--r--.
chmod 1777 directory: Sets permissions to drwxrwxrwt (sticky bit set, everyone has full access).
