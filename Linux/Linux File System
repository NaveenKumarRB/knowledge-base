Explanation of Key Directories

/ (Root): The top-level directory. Everything else is contained within it.

/bin (Essential User Binaries): Contains essential commands that all users need, such as ls, cp, mv, etc.

/boot (Boot Loader Files): Contains files needed to boot the system, such as the kernel and bootloader.

/dev (Device Files): Represents hardware devices as files. For example, /dev/sda might represent a hard drive.

/etc (Configuration Files): Stores system-wide configuration files for various programs and services.

/home (User Home Directories): Each user on the system typically has a subdirectory here (e.g., /home/username).

/lib (Essential Shared Libraries): Contains libraries needed by programs in /bin and /sbin.

/media (Mount Point for Removable Media): Used for mounting removable drives like USB sticks or CDs/DVDs.

/mnt (Temporary Mount Point): A temporary location for mounting filesystems.

/opt (Optional Application Packages): Used for installing optional software packages.

/root (Root User's Home Directory): The home directory for the root user (the system administrator). It's separate from /home for security reasons.

/sbin (System Administration Binaries): Contains system administration commands, typically used by the root user.

/srv (Service-Specific Data): Contains data related to services provided by the system (e.g., website data).

/tmp (Temporary Files): Stores temporary files that are usually deleted on reboot.

/usr (User Utilities and Applications): Contains user-related programs and data. It's further divided into:

/usr/bin: Non-essential user binaries.
/usr/include: Header files for C/C++ programming.
/usr/lib: Non-essential shared libraries.
/usr/sbin: Non-essential system administration binaries.
/var (Variable Data): Contains files that change frequently, such as logs, spool files, and temporary files. It's further divided into:

/var/cache: Cached data for applications.
/var/log: System log files.
/var/spool: Spooling data (e.g., print queues, mail queues).
/var/tmp: Temporary files that may persist across reboots.
Key Improvements in the Textual Representation:

Tree Structure: Using indentation and ├── (branch) and └── (last branch) characters clearly shows the hierarchy
